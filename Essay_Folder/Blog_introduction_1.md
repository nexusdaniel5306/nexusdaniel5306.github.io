Hello, and welcome to my blog\! Writing by hand seems to be a lost art these days, and I want to maintain my ability to write and communicate as much as possible. I’ve always thought of myself as a person with deep and varied interests (some at the bottom of this post), and sometimes it’s hard to keep up with all of them. I will make this a space where I can talk about all my thoughts and interests freely. There’s a few benefits to this apart from the first point I made, mainly that it gives me the ability to record my thoughts for future retrospect. The second order is that I get to understand my own questions and thought processes deeper by putting it down on paper, and hopefully find common ground, discourse with others and improve my writing skills in the meantime. 

Signing out until the first post, 

Daniel
