            <h1>Blog Introduction 1</h1>
            <p class="article-meta">Published on February 24, 2026</p>

            <p>Hello, and welcome to my blog! Writing by hand seems to be a lost art these days, and I want to maintain my ability to write and communicate as much as possible.</p>

            <p>I have always thought of myself as a person with deep and varied interests, and sometimes it is hard to keep up with all of them. I will make this a space where I can talk about my thoughts and interests freely. Besides that, it gives me the ability to record my thoughts for future retrospect.</p>

            <p>It also helps me understand my own questions and thought processes more deeply by putting them down on paper, and hopefully find common ground, discourse with others, and improve my writing skills in the meantime.</p>

            <p>Signing out until the first post,</p>
            <p>Daniel</p>
